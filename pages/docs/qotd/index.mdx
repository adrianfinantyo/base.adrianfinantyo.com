# ðŸ’¬QotD

QotD a.k.a [Quotes of the Day](https://af-qotd.vercel.app) is a simple
app that displays a random quote from a [list of quotes](https://gist.github.com/nasrulhazim/54b659e43b1035215cd0ba1d4577ee80).
This app is built using TypeScript, [Next](https://nextjs.org), and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com).

## Ideas

The ideas behind this app is the rise of motivating citation websites but it is a little or quite difficult to find free citation API providers. With the construction of this website, it is hoped that it can be used by web developer activists in practicing data fetching through APIs as well as entertainment for internet users in general.

## Why Next JS and Chakra UI?

The reason why I chose Nextjs and Chakra UI is that I want to try making a restful API and static site on the same project using Next and then Chakra UI is a very good UI library for React JS.

## Features Works

This app is still in the proccess of the development. Please feel free to give your feedback and suggestions. If you interested in contributing to this project, please feel free to contact me or directly fork this [repository](https://github.com/adrianfinantyo/quotes-of-the-day-nextjs) and make a pull request.
