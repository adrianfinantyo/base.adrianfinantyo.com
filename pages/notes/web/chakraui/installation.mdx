# Chakra UI Installation and Setup

Chakra UI is a simple, modular and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks you need to build your React applications.

## Installation

```bash copy
yarn add @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
```

After installing Chakra UI, you need to set up the ChakraProvider at the root of your application. This can be either in your index.jsx, index.tsx or App.jsx depending on the framework you use.

```jsx copy
import * as React from "react";

// 1. import `ChakraProvider` component
import { ChakraProvider } from "@chakra-ui/react";

function App() {
  // 2. Wrap ChakraProvider at the root of your app
  return (
    <ChakraProvider>
      <App />
    </ChakraProvider>
  );
}
```
